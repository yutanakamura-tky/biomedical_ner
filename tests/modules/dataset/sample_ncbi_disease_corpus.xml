A common human <disease type="DiseaseClass" mesh="D012878">skin tumour</disease> is caused by activating mutations in beta-catenin. WNT signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs. In response to this stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) is stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF/TCF family. One of the target genes for beta-catenin/TCF encodes c-MYC, explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to <disease type="DiseaseClass" mesh="D009369">cancer</disease>, particularly in the colon. Most <disease type="DiseaseClass" mesh="D003110">colon cancers</disease> arise from mutations in the gene encoding <disease type="SpecificDisease" mesh="D011125">adenomatous polyposis coli</disease> (<disease type="SpecificDisease" mesh="D011125">APC</disease>), a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, but a small percentage of <disease type="CompositeMention" mesh="D003110|D009369">colon and some other cancers</disease> harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing <disease type="DiseaseClass" mesh="D012878">skin tumours</disease> resembling <disease type="SpecificDisease" mesh="D018296">pilomatricomas</disease>. Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human <disease type="SpecificDisease" mesh="D018296">pilomatricomas</disease> might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Here, we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human <disease type="DiseaseClass" mesh="D012878">skin tumour</disease>. We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing <disease type="Modifier" mesh="D009369">tumour</disease> cells, providing biochemical evidence that <disease type="SpecificDisease" mesh="D018296">pilomatricomas</disease> are derived from hair matrix cells. At least 75% of these <disease type="DiseaseClass" mesh="D009369">tumours</disease> possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human <disease type="DiseaseClass" mesh="D009369">tumours</disease> examined thus far, and directly implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans..
